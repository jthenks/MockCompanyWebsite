# MockCompanyWebsite

This is a mock company website that my partner John Valiente and I made for a university assignment. 

The purpose of this website was to demonstrate our understanding of HTML. There isn't a high level of functionality, just the appearance of a realistic company website. 

We were very new to CSS at the time of creation.
